# Scientify - A Supporter for Scientific Research

## Problem

Scientific research is expensive as it requires highly capable individuals, expensive equipment and a lot of time. Because of this, it is limited to a handful of corporations and universities. The aim of this project is to help independent researchers to finance scientific research.

## How it works

Authenticated researchers can create a investment requisition to the public. They will have a reputation and will have to inform how much they need, what they will be doing, why and how. Supporters of this research can then invest in these projects and receive a representative token (ERC1155). For this hackthon they will only be able to invest with native tokens. Once the paper is published, the public will pay to consult it until there is enough money to pay back the investors. From this time on the research will become open source and token owners may burn their tokens in exchange for native coins.
